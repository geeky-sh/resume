## Summary

I have 13 years of experience in building consumer-facing products from scratch & scaling them.
My forte lies in understanding business problems in detail and architecting solutions that closely align with product goals. I believe in designing simple but long-term solutions to problems.

In addition, I have been in leadership positions for ~6 years and have built and managed a team of 10-15 engineers, guided and helped them hone their skills. Lastly, I have led the team to build scalable, modular and extensible products within stipulated timelines.
