                    I have 14 years of experience in building consumer-facing products from scratch & scaling them.
                    My forte lies in understanding business problems in detail and architecting solutions that closely align with product goals.
                    I believe in designing simple but long-term solutions to problems.
                    <br>
                    In addition, I have been in leadership positions for ~6 years and
                    have built and managed a team of 10-15 engineers, guided and helped them hone their skills.
                    Lastly, I have led the team to build scalable, modular and extensible products within stipulated timelines.
